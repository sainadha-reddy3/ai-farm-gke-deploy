🌾 AI-Based Farm Management System – FARM_ERA
🚀 Overview

FARM_ERA is an AI-powered farm management system designed to help farmers optimize productivity, sustainability, and resource efficiency using data-driven insights.
It integrates AI, GIS mapping, IoT sensors, and predictive analytics into one unified platform — built with Python, Streamlit, and OpenCV — providing actionable recommendations and real-time monitoring for modern precision agriculture.

🧠 Project Aim

To develop an intelligent, data-driven system that:

Monitors real-time farm conditions using sensors and IoT.

Provides predictive analytics for crop planning, yield forecasting, and irrigation scheduling.

Offers GIS-based field mapping and visual dashboards for easy decision-making.

Enhances sustainability by optimizing water, fertilizer, and pesticide use.

🏗️ System Architecture

The architecture of the AI-Based Farm Management System includes:

Data Acquisition Layer

Collects data from IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and weather APIs.

Captures soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall data.

AI & Analytics Layer

Uses machine learning and predictive analytics for crop yield estimation, pest detection, and irrigation optimization.

Optimization & Decision Layer

Generates smart irrigation schedules and crop management recommendations.

Detects anomalies in environmental data for proactive farm management.

Visualization & Interaction Layer

Interactive Streamlit dashboards.

Real-time OpenCV camera feed for irrigation system monitoring.

GeoJSON-based mapping using Folium.

🧩 Features
Module	Description

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AI-Farm-Management.git
cd AI-Farm-Management

2️⃣ Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install streamlit folium shapely geopy opencv-python pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

4️⃣ Run the application
streamlit run app.py

🧪 How It Works

Users input farm coordinates or upload GeoJSON files.
→ The system visualizes and calculates area and boundary distances.

Sensor data simulation (irrigator.py).
→ Generates random soil moisture and water flow data for each irrigation zone.

AI-driven decision support.
→ Predicts yields and irrigation schedules based on input parameters.

Real-time monitoring (cam.py).
→ Displays camera feed for irrigation system observation.

Visualization & Analysis.
→ Displays heatmaps, bar charts, and trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

🧾 Example Use Case

A farmer logs into FARM_ERA, uploads a GeoJSON map of their field, inputs soil data, and starts real-time irrigation monitoring.
The app analyzes water flow data, visualizes rainfall patterns, predicts yields, and suggests optimal irrigation schedules — all through an intuitive web dashboard.

🛡️ Data Security

Farm and sensor data are encrypted and locally stored.

Role-based access control can be added for multi-user systems.

No external API calls required — works offline for secure environments.

🧠 Future Enhancements

Integrate real IoT sensors (e.g., DHT11, soil moisture probes).

Deploy TensorFlow models for yield prediction and pest detection.

Add cloud-based analytics dashboards (AWS/GCP).

Incorporate voice-based farm assistant chatbot using local LLMs.
